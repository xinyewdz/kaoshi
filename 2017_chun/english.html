The English language is different from any other language. Yet English words do not stay the same. It is always changing. People need new words for new inventions and new ideas. Different words come into use, or older words are used in a new way.
    English can change by borrowing words from other languages. “Tomato” was borrowed from Mexico. The word “coffee” came from Turkey, and “tea” came from China. Now new space and science words are being borrowed from other countries, too.
New words are also made by adding two words together. “Strawberry,” “postman” and “grandfather” are made up of two parts. Sometimes new words are shorter forms of older words. The word “photo” was made from “photograph” by cutting off the end of the longer word. “Plane” was made by cutting off the front part of “aeroplane”. “Smog” was made by using only the first two and last two letters from the words “smoke” and “fog”.
The names of people and products can become new words. Our sandwich was named after a man named Sandwich. Scotch tape and jelly were names made up by the companies that first made the products.

When George Jones finished college, he became a clerk in a big company, hoping to advance to higher positions as time went on. He did his work reasonably well, but he wasn’t very smart, so when the older employees retired from higher positions, it was never Jones who was promoted.
After he had been with the company for fifteen years without ever being promoted, a smart young man, straight from college, came to work in the same department, and after a year, he was promoted above Jones.
Jones was very angry that he hadn’t been promoted instead of this young man, so he went to his manager and said, “I’ve had sixteen years’ experience on this job, yet a new man has been promoted over my head after having been here only one year.”

A man once said how useless it was to put advertisements in the newspapers. “Last week”, said he, “my umbrella was stolen from a London church. As it was a present, I spent twice its worth in advertising, but didn’t get it back.”
“How did you write your advertisement?” asked one of the listeners, a merchant.
“Here it is”, said the man, taking out of his pocket a slip cut from a newspaper. The other man took it and read, “Lost from the City Church last Sunday evening, a black silk umbrella. The gentleman who finds it will receive ten shillings on leaving it at No.10 Broad Street.”
“Now,” said the merchant, “I often advertise, and find that it pays me well. But the way in which an advertisement is expressed is of extreme importance. Let us try for your umbrella again, and if it fails, I’ll buy you a new one.”
The merchant then took a slip of paper out of his pocket and wrote: “If the man who was seen to take an umbrella from the City Church last Sunday evening doesn’t wish to get into trouble, he will return the umbrella to No.10 Broad Street. He is well known.”
This appeared in the paper, and on the following morning, the man was astonished when he opened the front door. In the doorway lay at least twelve umbrellas of all sizes and colors that had been thrown in, and his own was among the number. Many of them had notes fastened to them saying that they had been taken by mistake, and begging the loser not to say anything about the matter.

A. he was quite sure of success     
B. he was not sure he would get the umbrella back
C. he was rich enough to afford a new umbrella

Exercise is good for you, but most people really know very little about how to exercise properly. What do you know about exercise?
Some people think that in case you want to reduce the waistline, the best way is to do waist exercises. In fact, exercise burns fat from all over the body and not from one part of the body. When you reduce the fat throughout your body, you will certainly reduce your waistline, too! Exercise only twice a week is not enough, because unexercised muscles lose their strength very quickly. After 48 to 72 hours, you must use the muscles again to keep good physical fitness. So if you have enough time, exercise every day is best.
Some people think that in order to lose weight you should always “work up a good sweat” when exercising. That is a wrong idea. Sweating only lowers body temperature so that you won’t overheat; it does not help you reduce your weight. After exercise, you may weigh less, but this is because of water loss. Once you replace the water, you replace the weight.
Exercise is very important for everyone. It keeps us healthy. One of the best exercises is walking. Walking helps circulation of blood throughout the body, and it has a direct effect on your feeling of health. And if your breathing does not return to normal in minutes after you finish exercising, that means you have exercised too much. You’d better spend 20 minutes a day exercising, and that will keep you feeling good.

</pre>

<pre class="item"> 16. In paragraph 1, the world “properly” most probably means  B    .
  A. cleverly     B. correctly      C. gracefully     D. perfectly
</pre>

<pre class="item"> 17. You may lose your weight    A   .
A. after sweating because of water loss   B. after doing waist exercise properly
C. if you don’t replace water again     D. if you get overheat
</pre>

<pre class="item"> 18. Why will one weigh less after doing exercises for a period of time?     B
A. Because one will lose water during exercise.
B. Because one will lose fat during exercise.
C. Because one will lose strength during exercise.
D. Because one will lose muscles during exercise.
</pre>

<pre class="item"> 19. According to the passage, which of the following is true?        B
A. The best way to exercise is using the muscles as often as you can.
B. Daily exercise is the best way to keep fit.
C. Sweating helps you reduce your weight.
D. After doing 48—72 hours’ exercises, you must use the muscles again to keep fit.
</pre>

<pre class="item"> 20. The main idea of this passage is that      C  .
A. exercise is very important for everyone
B. exercise only twice a week is not enough
C. you should learn the suitable method of doing exercises
D. exercise burns fat from all over the body
