At the bottom of the world lies a large continent still wrapped in the Ice Age and, until recent times unknown to man. It is a great landmass. Much of the continent is a complete blank on our maps. This landmass is called Antarctica. Man has explored, on foot, less than one percent of its area.
Antarctica is quite different from the Arctic regions. The Arctic is an ocean, covered with drifting ice and surrounded by the landmass of Europe, Asia, and North America. The Antarctic is a continent almost as large as Europe and Australia put together and it is surrounded by continuous water areas of the world-the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Indian Ocean.
The continental ice sheet is more than two miles thick in its centre; thus, the air over the Antarctic is far colder than that over the Arctic regions. This cold air current from the land is so forceful that it makes the nearby seas the stormiest in the world and makes these areas unlivable. But at the opposite end of the globe, more than a million people live within 200 miles of the North Pole in an area that includes most of Alaska, Siberia, and Scandinavia-a region rich in forest and mining industries. On the contrary, within the same distance of the South Pole there is not a single tree, industry, or settlement, except some weather stations.

In this small town there was not a single man of importance who would dare to have a housekeeper younger than sixty, for fear of what people might say about them. I was an exception, however. When I needed a housekeeper I chose a girl called Bridie Casey, a lovely little girl of seventeen from a village up the coast. But I made my choice carefully. I drove out there one day when she was at home, and I had a look at the cottage and a talk with her mother and a cup of tea, and after that I did not need anyone to recommend her. I knew that if there was anything Bridie did not do properly her mother would not take long to correct her. After that, there was only one inquiry to make.
“Have you a boy-friend, Bridie?” said I.
“No, Doctor, I have not.” said she, with a simple expression that did not deceive me a bit. As a doctor you soon get used to innocent looks.
“Well, you’d better hurry up and get one. ” said I, “or I’m not going to take you.”
At this she laughed. The next day she started working at my house. She proved to be very capable and efficient. Of course, she was so good-looking that people who came to my house used to pass remarks about us. But that was only jealous. They did not dare to employ a pretty girl themselves for fear of what people would say. But I knew that as long as a girl had a man of her own to look after, she would give me no trouble.

The entertainment profession, or “show business”, attracts many young people. Unfortunately, only very few can hope to become famous and prosperous. Talent is not enough, because show business is as competitive as any other business. Without a good manager, a performer can never hope to succeed. Fashion is important in this business, too. The best tailor in the world will never be a success if he makes old-fashioned clothes. In exactly the same way, a performer must change his “act” in order to follow the taste of the moment. This is true for actors, dancers and comedians, but perhaps most of all for singers.
   “Pop” stands for “popular”, and a pop singer has to work very hard to become popular. He must either give the public what they already want, or he must find a new way of singing that will attract their attention. Even when he has succeeded, and his records are sold everywhere, he cannot relax. Then he must work harder than ever to remain popular, because there are always younger singers trying to become famous and to steal some of the popularity.
   The life of a successful pop singer is not at all easy. He can only relax when he is alone, because everything he does is watched and reported in the special newspaper written for the “fans”. The fans are the most important people in the world for the singer. They buy his records, they go to his concerts, and they make him rich and famous. But they can be very annoying, too. Sometimes their enthusiasm gets so hysterical that they do anything to get a “souvenir”. They steal handkerchiefs, they tear off buttons, and they even cut off pieces of the unfortunate singer’s hair. Many singers have been forced to hide, and some who have not been so lucky as to escape have been stripped practically naked by their fans. A pop singer has to spend a lot of money on clothes, because he must always look smart, or, at any rate, different. He must have a luxurious car. And ---- most important--- he must always keep smiling for the benefit of his public.


<pre class="item">11. A suitable title for this passage might be    D   .
  A. The Entertainment Profession			B. The Way to Become a Pop Singer
C. The Life of a Pop Singer				D. The Pop Singer
</pre>

D. not a few people may become pop singers

“Equal pay for equal work” is a phrase used by the American women who complain about what they feel is unjust treatment by society. Clearly it is unfair, they say, for women to be paid less than men for the same work.
People who hold the opposite view (mainly men) have an answer to this. They say that men have more responsibilities than women: a married man is expected to earn money to support his family and to make the important family decisions, and therefore it is right for men to be paid more. There are some people who hold even stronger views than this and are against married women working at all. When wives go out to work, they say, the home and children are neglected. If women are encouraged by equal pay to take full-time jobs, they will be unable to do the things they are best at doing: making a comfortable home and bringing up children. They will have to give up their traditional position in society.
This is exactly what they want to give up, the women who disagree say. They want to escape from the limited place which society expects them to fill, and to have freedom to choose between a career or home life, or a mixture of the tow. Women have the right not only to equal pay but also to equal opportunities.
These women have expressed their opinion forcefully by using the famous statement about human rights made in the American Declaration of Independence in 1776:”all men are created equal.” They point out that the meaning of this sentence was “all human beings are created equal.”


<pre class="item">16.  The women use the phrase “equal pay for equal work” to make an appeal that _____C_____.
A. men should be paid less than women
B. women’s work should not be harder than men’s
C. women’s rates of pay should not differ from men’s
D. men should be kinder to women at work.
</pre>
<pre class="item">17.  Some people are against married women working at all because they say that ______C____.
A. women are only suited to working at home
B. men cannot take care of children
C. women will not take good care of their homes and children
D. all men will lose their traditional role in society
</pre>
<pre class="item">18.  People who disagree with “equal pay for equal work” believe that ______D____.
A. men have to do more in the home than women
B. men have to work much harder than women
C. men can earn money more easily than women
D. men’s responsibilities are different from women’s
</pre>
<pre class="item">19.  The women who disagree say that ________B__.
A. women need opportunities to get out of the house more often
B. women want more freedom in deciding the kind of life they lead
C. women are no longer interested in taking care of their homes.
D. If women are given equal pay, their opportunities will be greater.
</pre>
<pre class="item">20.  The women use the statement “all men are created equal” to show that _____A_____.
A. a basic principle of American society is that men and women are equal
B. the position of women has improved a little in modern times
C. men and women had equal power in early American society
D. governments always consider men’s tight more important than women’s
